How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
  
  -The best way to interpret and implement user needs would be through system analysis.  We will need feedback from the users to implement in the 
   in the coding while identifying the inputs and outputs for the system.
  
  -User stories are always the best way to discover the users needs.  This tool helps to understand the end-users perspective and what they want 
   so that we initiate a simple requirement description for them.



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  
  -I will approach developing programs by one of two methodologies; waterfall or agile, depending on the complexity of the program.  For the small,
   simple, and set in stone projects, it will be best to go with waterfall to keep things simple and to the point.  For the larger and more complex
   projects I will use an agile aproach, providing flexibility for any changes that may occur during the development process.
  
  -The agile process that I hope to include in future development work will be Scrum.  I believe that communication is everything, and the Scrum 
   will allow the most opportunity to each team member to express their work, concerns and ideas.



What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
  -The main part of being a good team member in software development is holding yourself accountable.  Before we can help others, we must insure 
   that our work is being completed correctly and on time.  Then would come communication.  Transparently relaying and discussing the aspects of 
   of the work completed and in the process of completion is crucial.  It is also crucial to always express any concerns or ideas; these could save 
   other team members a lot of time and trouble if they are effective and relevant.
